  Ash Boat is an innovation-oriented visual novel. He has made absolutely bold innovations in his worldview and brushwork. It also contains a comic.

  In the Ash Boat, you'll guide a pair of brothers from El Cayong on a journey to escape the chaos of war from a third-person perspective and unlock the secrets of the third-person themselves.

  Each chapter of the Ash Boat has a certain difficulty to read, and some chapters may require some new literary skills to read. If you can't read these chapters, you can choose to skip them. This doesn't have much impact on your grasp of the plot.

  The total play time of Ash Boat is about one hour per chapter per line (depending on the reading speed and the number of repeated readings). It contains a certain amount of linguistic decryption, which is directly related to unlocking subsequent plots (or comic book plots).

  Ash Boat is also a public resource library, and all original materials in it are copyrighted under the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 International license. This includes our standing art library, illustration library, music library, interface design library, copywriting, etc.
