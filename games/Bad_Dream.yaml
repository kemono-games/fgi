  ## INTRODUCTION

  An adventure video game (21+) on its bones and a book on its soul, about vices and emotions.

  We are all prey of our desires, and they will hunt us until we tame them. Find the truthful desires of your heart in this FPS and VN hybrid.

  Lust, Wrath and Justice as your punishers... Or partners! Your main weapon is your wit. Take any chance to wisely team up, but be aware that many deals will affect your game play later on!

  ## STORY

  Once promised a prosperous future, our protagonist, stoled a HDD of the evil company he worked for, now hunted by a PMC, who was his first love, and is trying to retrieve the HDD or maybe recover their old love?

  Wishing the Lust of their past is enough to overcome the Wrath in their present, we gotta try to talk things out, or run very fast!

  * Switch to other characters as the adventure goes on.
  * The game features writers, artists and small businesses from real life!
  * Animated endings, mini-games and event scenes.

  ## ABOUT US

  We are a game studio of 3 developers and count with collaborators from all over the world.

  We focus on diverse game mechanics that keep making the game different, mini games, mini bosses, to ease the mind from the overly serious main route. We aim to have quirky characters that will be like none around. So expect a lot of bad jokes and mischief!

  ## COSMETICS

  There’s a wardrobes on a city mall, abandoned, just for you and your crew, go wild ;3

  ## CONCLUSION

  Sometimes the stories that challenge us are the ones that pull us thru our hardest times, games are the Book that will give encouraging words, the Music that will motivate us through a work day and the Art that will give us a break for an eye sore gray reality.

  Games are a mixture of all art types, we believe developers can focus on  each of them and display a sensitive world.
